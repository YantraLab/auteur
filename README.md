### üîå Plugin Architecture

Auteur is built on a flexible plugin architecture, allowing developers to easily create and add their own custom board types. All of the core boards (like Ideaboard and Moodboard) are built using this same system.

A plugin is a simple object that registers itself with the application and provides the necessary components for rendering. Here's the basic structure of a plugin definition:

```typescript
// plugins/my-plugin/index.ts
import { registerPlugin } from '../../pluginSystem/pluginRegistry';
import { MyPluginView } from './MyPluginView';
import { MyIcon } from '../../components/icons';

const myPlugin = {
    type: 'PLUGIN_MY_COOL_BOARD', // A unique identifier
    title: 'My Cool Board',         // Name in the UI
    description: 'A short description.',
    icon: MyIcon,                  // React component for the icon
    boardComponent: MyPluginView,    // React component for the board view
};

export function initializeMyPlugin() {
    registerPlugin(myPlugin);
}
```

To add your plugin to the app, simply import and call your initializer function in `plugins/index.ts`.
